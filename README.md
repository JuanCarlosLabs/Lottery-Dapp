# Lottery-Dapp
Lottery Dapp is a decentralized lottery where players buy tickets with ETH. When the maximum number of tickets is sold, a winner is chosen with randomness from Chainlink VRF. The full prize pool is sent to the winner automatically. The lottery resets after each round for continuous play.
